Minidash is a reinterpretation of the original [dashboard project][dashboard].
Its goal is to be a lot more lightweight than the original project, whilst being simpler to configure and run.
It uses Rust for setting up a web server and reading the configuration, making the source code incredibly compact.

## Running this project

To run this project, simply run:

```sh
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v $PWD/data:/app/data phntxx/minidash
```

You will however need the `data`-directory for this. Just download [the data directory from this repository](https://github.com/phntxx/minidash/tree/main/data/) as a starting-off point and then adjust that to fit your needs.

## Development

This project is built using cargo, so building the project is as simple as running:

```sh
cargo run
```

However, environment variables are needed for this to run right, see [Configuration:Environment Variables](#environment-variables)

## Configuration

This project can be configured using files and environment variables to suit your needs just right.

### Files

This project requires two files: The template and the configuration file.

The template file is a simple [handlebar][handlebars]-template. Use the one supplied [here][template] or use it as an example to make your own.

The configuration file is a YAML file that contains all of your links, be it apps or bookmarks. By default, it looks like this:

```yml
---
apps:

  app_name:
    url: app_url
    display_url: app_display_url
    icon: app_icon

  ...

bookmarks:

  group_name:
    - name: group_item_name
      url: group_item_url

    ...

  ...
```

### Environment variables

This tool requires three environment variables to be set:

- `TEMPLATE_FILE`: The path to the template file. With the docker image this defaults to `/app/template.hbs`.
- `CONFIG_FILE`: The path to the config file. With the docker image this defaults to `/app/config.yml`.
- `STATIC_PATH`: The path where static files are hosted. These can then be accessed by navigating to - e.g. - `/static/test.png`. With the docker image this defaults to `/app/data/static`.
- `ADDRESS`: The IP-address and port that the web server should listen on. With the docker image this defaults to `0.0.0.0:3000`.

These three variables need to be set when running `cargo run` in order for the program to do anything.

Additionally, since this project uses the [`env-logger`][env-logger] crate, the `RUST_LOG` environment variable can also be modified to adjust logging levels.
